CS-465 Full Stack development

Architecture

    -Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
      Javascript, of course, is a scripting language more than a frontend system. It allows for more andvanced functions to be performed in a traditional HTML environment. 
      Express HTML was a lot of fun to look at. I found it a massive upgrade traditional HTML, and the power it brings in controlling routing and other such features is 
      astounding. The Angular SPA was nice, in that it created a streamlined admin system. I really enjoyed learning it, even if the course itself had some very 
      problematic sources.
      
    -Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
      NoSQL MongoDB is, generally, much faster and more scalable. It is also more cloud focused than a traditional SQL database. Additionally, it can handle less structured 
      data better than its SQL counterparts. All of these features were beneficial to the client's app requirements.

Functionality

    -How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
      JSON is derived from Javascript, but similarities, generally, end there. However, JSON is more focused on restrictive passing of data. It is also language agnostic, 
      and can work out of the box with many programming languages, whereas Javascript works with just Javascript. JSON is often used to transfer data from a server to a client side web page.
      
    
    -Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
      We should always strive for reusable code, and UI components are no different. The ability to quickly make a new element based on a previous component saves time and errors. 
      There were a lot of moments where we had to find ways to make code work, or work better. The guides for this course were less than stellar, and often left us with broken code.
      
Testing

    -Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain 
    your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
      Endpoints work similar to webpages, in that they represent a specific part of the program that can be navigated to with the proper routing. A proper authorization service 
      can control and limit both routes and elements of an application if a user is not logged in to an account with the appropriate privledges. 

Reflection

    -How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
      I have to be honest, I did pick up a bit of knowledge and understanding of full-stack development, but it was almost in spite of the coursework. The coursework was often broken, and at times extremely 
      difficult to follow. It really lessened what I might have gotten from this course. Still, the foundation in MEAN stack and the principles there will be beneficial. I think I could like full-stack development, 
      though I would like more time to build proper applications that work as designed.
